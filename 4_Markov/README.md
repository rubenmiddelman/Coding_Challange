# 4 Midi Markov chain

challange 4 was to make a markov chain example, i've always learned to make markov chains to generate new music so here is a small project for that. it takes a midi file and generates a new file based on the old one. 

## added features
1. Basic markov
2. uses chance of appearance of the note.

## Feature ideas for the future
1. Velocity
2. time duration
3. multiple notes at the same time
4. multiple instruments
