# Number 10, to do list application

i've chosen to do something weird here and make a to do list application in bash. I've been wanting to learn to write bash scripts for a long time, so i've decided to do some of the simple challanges in bash to get a feel of the language. this application is very basic maybe later i will expand the program with more features

## Implemented features
create list
task deletion
list deletion
task creation
task with priority
can open the list on later dates
